#### SWIPE INTRODUCTION
Swipe is a complete payment platform for businesses.

We help businesses to accept, manage and distribute payment worldwide and is ready to be adopted by companies ranging from startups to large corporations.

#### WHY CHOOSE SWIPE?
Swipe has no setup fees, no monthly fees, no hidden costs: you only get charged when you earn money! Earnings are transferred to your bank account on a 3-day rolling basis.

#### WEB PAYMENTS API SUPPORT
Swipe for WooCommerce includes Web Payments API support, allowing customers to pay using payment information associated with their mobile devices in browsers that support the Web Payments API (Chrome for Android, amongst others). On mobile, checkout is now just a few taps away.

#### SWIPE API SYNC
Swipe introduces a new way to integrate our platform with your stores in less than 1 min. You no longer have to worry about where to get the API Access Key or API Signature Key from the payment platform. We have you covered! 

The new technology helps non-technical or first time users to integrate with our payment platform with your login details only. We help to fetch the API keys automatically and you just have to install our plugin. It is that simple! [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mhcNP-xKWg)
